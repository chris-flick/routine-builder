/**
 * entry: tells Webpack where our application starts and where to start bundling files
 * mode: tells Webpack that we're in development mode
 * module: helps define how my exported JS modules are transformed and which ones to include
 *      test and include: conditions to match files against
 * 
 * 1st rule: tells webpack to exclude node_modules/bower_components and to transform .js/.jsx
 *           files using Babel
 * 2nd rule: tells webpack to use css-loader to transform .css files
 * 
 * resolve: allows us to specify which extensions Webpack will resolve - this allows us
 *          to import modules without needing to add their extensions
 * 
 * output: tells webpack where to put our bundled code
 * publicPath: which directory the bundle should go in. 
 *          Also tells webpack-dev-server where to serve files from.
